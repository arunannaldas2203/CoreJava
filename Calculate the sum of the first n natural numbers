We set n to the number of natural numbers you want to sum.
We initialize a variable sum to zero. This variable will store the sum of the numbers.
The for loop iterates from 1 to n. In each iteration, it adds the value of i to the sum variable.

        
        int sum=0;
        int n=10;
        for (int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            sum+= i;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
