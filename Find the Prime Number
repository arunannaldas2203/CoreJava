Prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and divided by 1 or itself only:-
            int number = 11;
            int count =0;
            for (int j =1;j<=number;j++) {
                if( number%j==0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count==2){
                System.out.println("given number is prime number ");
            }else{
                System.out.println("given number is not a prime number ");
           }
