To calculate the area of a rectangle in Java, you need to multiply its length by its width. Here's a simple Java program that does this:

public class Area1 {

    int length;
    int breadth;
    public void setDim(int length,int breadth){
       this.length = length;
       this.breadth = breadth;
    }
    public int getArea(){
       int  areaOfRectangle = length*breadth;
       return  areaOfRectangle;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Area1 area = new Area1();
        area.setDim(10,21);
        System.out.println( area.getArea());

    }
}
